# twitter_autopost
Drupal module content auto post to twitter. Currently being built......

## TODO
- Yeah Still an issue -> Figure out why the hell the values arent being passed in like screen_name_id, is this a scope issue?
- Rewrite the autoposting alg since I am now using a form_alter to add a field,


## Things to do next
- Lets use twitter_signin_user_insert hook to add the screen name automatically
